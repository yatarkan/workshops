    "1. Learn the basics of neural model analysis and optimization:\n",

This has enabled the development of various revolutionary AI applications. With Deep Learning, the algorithm does not need to be taught about the essential features: it can discover features from data on its own using a neural network. Deep Learning algorithms usually use a lot of data and aim to emulate the human brain capacity to observe, learn, and make decisions, particularly for highly complex tasks. \n",

    "\n",
    "To perform a specific AI task, a model is trained on the known data. During training, the model makes predictions about what the data represents. Any error in the prediction is used to strengthen the artificial neuron connections until an acceptable accuracy level is achieved. Training is usually performed only once and requires massive amount of data and powerful computing systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inference is the process of using a pre-trained model to make predictions against previously unseen data. Inference is performed on different devices, happens several times, and consists in feeding the images to the model. In this workshop we will work with model inference; in other words, we will execute the model pre-trained for a certain use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](pictures/inference_cv.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the inference on the real-life example of the vehicle detection model. The model, running alongside the traffic camera, is continuously processing a video to identify the cars approaching the intersection. \n",
    "1. When a car enters at the red light, several photos of this car are taken by the camera and fed to the model. The model finds a license plate on the image and sends it for further processing.\n",
    "2. At the server, the first inference is run to localize the license plate in the image. The second inference is performed to read the characters on the license plate. \n",
    "3. After this, the license plate information is sent to the data center, where an application checks for potential traffic violations. \n",

In this case, the pre-trained model requires some accelerating modifications and compression. So let's find out how the OpenVINO™ toolkit can help in achieving better performance of Deep Learning models."
